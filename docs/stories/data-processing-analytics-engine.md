# Data Processing & Analytics Engine

**Story ID:** DATA-001  
**Created:** 2025-01-27  
**Story Points:** 8 (Medium - complex data processing)  
**Priority:** High (Core functionality for MVP)

---

## **User Story**

**As a** security operations manager  
**I want to** upload camera event data and have it automatically processed into meaningful analytics  
**So that** I can get immediate insights about dwell time, occupancy patterns, and visitor behavior without manual data analysis

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**

### 1. CSV Data Ingestion & Validation
- [ ] Parse CSV files with camera event data
- [ ] Validate required columns: timestamp, person_id, camera_id, event_type
- [ ] Handle various timestamp formats (ISO, Unix, custom formats)
- [ ] Detect and report data quality issues (missing values, invalid formats)
- [ ] Support file sizes up to 100MB with progress tracking
- [ ] Store raw data in PostgreSQL with proper indexing

### 2. Dwell Time Calculation Engine
- [ ] Calculate dwell time for each person (time between entry and exit events)
- [ ] Handle multiple entry/exit events per person per session
- [ ] Aggregate dwell times by person, camera, and time periods
- [ ] Calculate average, median, and maximum dwell times
- [ ] Handle edge cases (incomplete sessions, data gaps)
- [ ] Store calculated dwell time data in optimized format

### 3. Analytics Computation Service
- [ ] Real-time calculation of KPI metrics:
  - Total unique visitors
  - Average dwell time per person
  - Maximum dwell time observed
  - Total events processed
  - Number of cameras with activity
- [ ] Generate occupancy analytics (visitors per time period)
- [ ] Calculate repeat visitor statistics
- [ ] Create time-based aggregations (hourly, daily, weekly)
- [ ] Cache analytics results for performance

### 4. Data Aggregation & Grouping
- [ ] Group analytics by person, camera, time periods
- [ ] Support demographic attributes if present in data
- [ ] Create summary statistics for each grouping
- [ ] Generate data for chart visualizations
- [ ] Optimize queries for large datasets

### 5. API Endpoints for Analytics
- [ ] REST API endpoints for retrieving analytics data
- [ ] Support for filtering by date range, camera, person
- [ ] Pagination for large result sets
- [ ] JSON response format for frontend consumption
- [ ] API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

### 6. Error Handling & Data Quality
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for malformed data
- [ ] Data validation and cleaning procedures
- [ ] Logging of processing errors and warnings
- [ ] User-friendly error messages for invalid data
- [ ] Data quality metrics and reporting

## **Technical Requirements**

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **CSV Parser:** Pandas with custom validation
- **Dwell Time Engine:** Custom Python algorithms
- **Analytics Engine:** Pandas/Numpy for calculations
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with optimized schemas
- **Caching:** Redis for analytics results
- **API:** FastAPI with async processing

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Extended camera events table with calculated fields
ALTER TABLE camera_events ADD COLUMN session_id VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE camera_events ADD COLUMN dwell_duration INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE camera_events ADD COLUMN is_entry BOOLEAN;
ALTER TABLE camera_events ADD COLUMN is_exit BOOLEAN;

-- Analytics cache table for performance
CREATE TABLE analytics_cache (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    cache_key VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    metric_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    calculated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Person sessions table for dwell time tracking
CREATE TABLE person_sessions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    person_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    camera_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    entry_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    exit_time TIMESTAMP,
    dwell_duration INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Processing Algorithms
- **Dwell Time Calculation:**
  - Match entry/exit events by person_id and camera_id
  - Calculate time difference for complete sessions
  - Handle overlapping sessions and data gaps
  - Aggregate by time periods and cameras

- **Analytics Computation:**
  - Real-time metric calculation on data upload
  - Caching strategy for frequently accessed metrics
  - Batch processing for large datasets
  - Incremental updates for new data

### Performance Requirements
- Process 10,000+ events in under 30 seconds
- Support concurrent uploads and processing
- Cache analytics results for 1 hour
- Database queries optimized for large datasets
- Memory-efficient processing for large files

---

## **Definition of Done**

- [ ] CSV files are parsed and validated successfully
- [ ] Dwell time calculations are accurate and handle edge cases
- [ ] Analytics metrics are computed in real-time
- [ ] API endpoints return correct data with proper filtering
- [ ] Error handling covers all common data quality issues
- [ ] Performance meets requirements for large datasets
- [ ] Database schema is optimized for analytics queries
- [ ] Caching system improves response times
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and monitoring is in place
- [ ] Unit tests cover core processing algorithms
- [ ] API documentation is complete and accurate

## **Dependencies**

- SETUP-001 (Project Setup & Development Environment)
- Database schema design and implementation
- Basic API framework setup
- Authentication system foundation

---

## **Notes**

This story implements the core data processing engine that powers all analytics features. It's critical for the MVP as it transforms raw camera data into actionable insights.

**Key Success Metrics:**
- Data processing accuracy > 99%
- Processing time < 30 seconds for 10,000 events
- API response time < 2 seconds for analytics queries
- Error rate < 1% for valid data files

**Future Considerations:**
- Engine should support JSON crowd/loitering data in Phase 2
- Real-time processing capabilities for live data feeds
- Machine learning integration for anomaly detection
- Support for multiple data sources and formats
