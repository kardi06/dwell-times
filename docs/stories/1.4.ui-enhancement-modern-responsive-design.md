## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Current components use basic styling without a design system
- File upload functionality is working but needs visual enhancement
- Authentication flow is functional but lacks modern design
- Dashboard layout is functional but needs better visual hierarchy
- Need to transition from basic styling to Tailwind CSS utility-first approach

### Data Models
- No new data models required for this story
- Existing authentication and analytics data structures remain unchanged
- Component props interfaces may need updates for new styling props

### API Specifications
- No new API endpoints required
- Existing authentication and analytics endpoints remain unchanged
- All current API calls will continue to work with enhanced UI

### Component Specifications
**LoginForm Component:**
- Location: `frontend/src/components/Auth/LoginForm.tsx`
- Props: `onLogin: (token: string) => void`
- Styling: Tailwind CSS utility classes with custom design tokens
- Enhanced error handling and loading states
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

**Dashboard Component:**
- Location: `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`
- Props: `token: string`, `onLogout: () => void`
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with responsive grid system
- Enhanced KPI cards with animations using Tailwind classes
- Improved tab navigation with better visual feedback

**New Component Library:**
- Location: `frontend/src/components/ui/`
- Components: Button, Card, Input, Loading, Alert, Skeleton
