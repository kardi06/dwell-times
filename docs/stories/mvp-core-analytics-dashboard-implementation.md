# MVP Core Analytics Dashboard Implementation

**Story ID:** MVP-001  
**Created:** 2025-01-27  
**Story Points:** 13 (Large - involves full-stack implementation)  
**Priority:** High (MVP Foundation)

---

## **User Story**

**As a** security operations manager  
**I want to** upload camera event data and see key analytics immediately  
**So that** I can quickly assess visitor patterns and dwell time insights for security decision-making

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**

### 1. File Upload & Validation
- [x] Drag-and-drop interface accepts CSV files with camera event data
- [x] File validation checks schema (required columns: timestamp, person_id, camera_id, event_type)
- [x] Clear error messages for invalid files
- [x] Success feedback when upload completes
- [x] File size limits and progress indicators

### 2. Core Analytics Dashboard
- [x] KPI cards displaying:
  - Total unique visitors
  - Average dwell time per person
  - Maximum dwell time observed
  - Total events processed
  - Number of cameras with activity
- [x] Real-time calculation of metrics from uploaded data
- [x] Responsive layout that works on desktop/tablet
- [x] Loading states and error handling

### 3. Interactive Event Table
- [x] Sortable table showing all processed events
- [x] Columns: timestamp, person_id, camera_id, dwell_duration, event_type
- [x] Pagination for large datasets
- [x] CSV export functionality
- [x] Basic filtering by camera_id
- [x] Search functionality across all columns

### 4. Basic Authentication
- [x] Simple login form (username/password)
- [x] JWT token-based authentication
- [x] Protected routes for dashboard and upload
- [x] Session management
- [x] Logout functionality

## **Technical Requirements**

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework:** React + TypeScript with Vite
- **UI Library:** Material UI or Chakra UI for components
- **Charts:** Recharts for basic charts (histogram for dwell time distribution)
- **File Upload:** Drag-and-drop with validation
- **Layout:** Responsive dashboard layout
- **State Management:** React Context or Redux for app state

### Backend Stack
- **API Framework:** FastAPI with Python
- **Data Processing:** Pandas for CSV parsing and analytics
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for data storage
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with secure storage
- **File Handling:** Multipart file upload with validation
- **Analytics:** Custom calculation modules

### Data Processing Requirements
- **CSV Parsing:** Handle various timestamp formats
- **Dwell Time Calculation:** Time between entry/exit events per person
- **Aggregation:** Group by person, camera, time periods
- **Real-time Metrics:** Calculate KPIs on upload completion
- **Data Validation:** Schema checking and data quality validation

---

## **Definition of Done**

- [x] User can upload CSV file and see validation feedback
- [x] Dashboard displays accurate KPI metrics
- [x] Event table shows all data with sorting/pagination
- [x] Authentication works and protects all routes
- [x] Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- [x] CSV export functionality works
- [x] Code follows project architecture patterns
- [x] Basic error handling and user feedback implemented
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Documentation for API endpoints
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets

---

## **Dependencies**

- Project setup and basic architecture
- Database schema design
- Authentication system setup
- Development environment configuration

---

## **Notes**

This story implements the core MVP functionality from the PRD. It focuses on the essential upload → process → visualize flow that delivers immediate value to security teams. The story is scoped to handle the most critical user journey while establishing the foundation for future features.

**Key Success Metrics:**
- Upload success rate > 95%
- Dashboard load time < 3 seconds
- Table pagination handles 10,000+ records
- Authentication flow completes in < 2 seconds

**Future Considerations:**
- This establishes the foundation for Phase 2 features (advanced filtering, charts)
- Database schema should support future multi-user and real-time features
- API design should accommodate future integrations
