# Story 1.5: CSV Data Processing & EventTable Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user of the Dwell-Insight analytics platform,
**I want to** upload CSV files with camera event data and see the processed data displayed in the EventTable,
**so that** I can analyze dwell time patterns and visitor behavior from real camera data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **CSV Data Processing:**
   - [ ] Parse CSV files with camera event data matching the image structure
   - [ ] Extract required fields: person_id, camera_id, camera_description, zone_name, utc_time_started_readable, utc_time_ended_readable
   - [ ] Calculate dwell time as (utc_time_ended_readable - utc_time_started_readable) during upload
   - [ ] Store raw CSV data + calculated dwell_time in existing camera_events table
   - [ ] Handle data validation and error reporting for malformed CSV files

2. **Database Schema & Storage:**
   - [ ] Use existing camera_events table with dwell_time column for calculated values
   - [ ] Implement proper indexing for person_id, camera_description, dwell_time, created_at
   - [ ] Handle data type conversions (timestamps, durations) during CSV processing
   - [ ] Support bulk insert operations for large CSV files with pre-calculated dwell_time

3. **EventTable Integration:**
   - [ ] Update EventTable to display aggregated data from camera_events table
   - [ ] Show grouped data: person_id, camera_description, total_dwell_time, event_count, created_at
   - [ ] Implement sorting by all columns with fast queries using pre-calculated dwell_time
   - [ ] Add filtering by camera_description and zone_name
   - [ ] Update search functionality to work with grouped data structure
   - [ ] Update CSV export to include aggregated columns

4. **Analytics & Aggregation:**
   - [ ] Use SQL GROUP BY to aggregate dwell time data by person_id and camera_description
   - [ ] Calculate total_dwell_time, avg_dwell_time, event_count per person per camera
   - [ ] Display aggregated statistics in KPI cards using pre-calculated values
   - [ ] Support filtering and grouping in EventTable with optimized queries

5. **Performance & Error Handling:**
   - [ ] Handle large CSV files efficiently with progress tracking and pre-calculated dwell_time
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling for data processing failures
   - [ ] Add loading states during data processing and fast query responses
   - [ ] Optimize database queries using indexes on person_id, camera_description, dwell_time

  - [ ] Add data validation and quality checks for timestamp formats

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.2 (Data Processing & Analytics Engine) provides the foundation for CSV processing
- Story 1.3 (MVP Core Analytics Dashboard) shows the current EventTable implementation
- Story 1.4 (UI Enhancement) has modernized the UI components with Tailwind CSS
- Current EventTable uses mock data and needs to be connected to real backend

### Data Models
**CameraEvent Interface (Updated for Aggregated View):**
```typescript
interface CameraEvent {
  person_id: string;
  camera_description: string;
  total_dwell_time: number; // in seconds, pre-calculated
  avg_dwell_time: number; // in seconds, pre-calculated
  event_count: number; // number of events for this person/camera
  created_at: string; // ISO timestamp of latest event
}
```

**CSV Data Structure (from image):**
- person_id: string (e.g., "client-29b-efd4-f7b-738-b970093eb")
- camera_id: string (e.g., "961db544-5f2f-4d12-8087-a5b22c7183")
- camera_description: string (e.g., "Video 1")
- zone_name: string (e.g., "Cashier queue")
- utc_time_started_readable: string (e.g., "7/28/2025 10:00")
- utc_time_ended_readable: string (e.g., "7/28/2025 10:00")

**Dwell Time Calculation:**
- Formula: `dwell_time = utc_time_ended_readable - utc_time_started_readable`
- Calculated during CSV upload and stored in `dwell_time` column
- Used for fast queries and aggregations

### API Specifications

**Analytics Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/aggregated-dwell-time`
- Query parameters: group_by (person_id, camera_description)
- Returns aggregated dwell time statistics using pre-calculated dwell_time values
- Fast queries using database indexes on person_id, camera_description, dwell_time

### Component Specifications
**EventTable Component Updates:**
- Location: `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/EventTable.tsx`
