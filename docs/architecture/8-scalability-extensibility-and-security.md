# 8. Scalability, Extensibility, and Security

**Scalability:**

- **Batch/Async Processing:**\
  Celery offloads heavy jobs; Redis queue enables parallel processing. Horizontal scaling possible by adding more workers.
- **Efficient Aggregation:**\
  Use DB indexes and pre-aggregated tables for fast dashboard queries.
- **Partitioning:**\
  Future: Partition raw event/crowd tables by date or camera to keep queries fast at scale.
- **Containerization:**\
  Docker makes it easy to scale up (multiple API/backend/worker instances) for load balancing.

**Extensibility:**

- **Pluggable Data Sources:**\
  Data ingest can be switched from manual upload to direct API fetch (Corsight) with minimal disruption.
- **Modular Analytics:**\
  Processing pipeline can add new metrics (zone mapping, anomaly detection, custom watchlists) as separate modules/jobs.
- **UI Extensibility:**\
  Dashboard supports new cards, filters, or charts with no full rewrite. Backend can expose new endpoints as needed.
- **Future Features:**\
  Workspace/multi-user support, advanced alerting/notifications, API/webhook for integration with BI tools.

**Security:**

- **Authentication & Authorization:**\
  JWT-based login, user roles (admin, viewer, etc.), access control on sensitive endpoints.
- **File Validation:**\
  Strict schema checking, sanitization, and size limits to block malicious input.
- **Transport Security:**\
  Enforce HTTPS everywhere, CORS policy for API.
- **Operational Security:**\
  Logging, monitoring, and audit trails for uploads/edits.\
  Prepared for GDPR/data retention features if required.
