# 7. User Stories / Flows

## MVP User Stories

- **As a user, I want to upload a CSV or JSON file**, so I can analyze camera and crowd data without manual parsing.
- **As a user, I want to see a dashboard of key metrics** (total visitors, dwell time, events) as soon as my data is uploaded and processed.
- **As a user, I want to view and filter a detailed table of events and sessions**, so I can investigate individual entries or export for compliance.
- **As a user, I want to sort, filter, and export the event/session table to CSV**, so I can share or archive reports.
- **As a user, I want to log in securely**, so that only authorized staff can access data and dashboards.

## Phase 2+ User Stories

- **As a user, I want to filter analytics by camera, date range, or demographics**, so I can drill down to relevant insights.
- **As a user, I want to see charts of occupancy and crowding over time**, so I can spot patterns or anomalies.
- **As a user, I want to identify and analyze repeat visitors** and see their historical dwell patterns.
- **As a user, I want to be alerted when occupancy or dwell time exceeds a threshold**, so I can respond to crowding or loitering incidents in real time.
- **As an admin, I want to manage users, file uploads, and project history**, so teams can collaborate securely and track changes.
- **As an analyst, I want to integrate data with BI tools**, so I can build custom reports beyond the standard dashboard.

## Example User Flow: Upload to Dashboard

1. **User logs in.**
2. Navigates to the Upload page, drags a CSV/JSON file, and submits.
3. Receives feedback on upload status; if valid, processing starts.
4. When complete, is redirected to Dashboard showing summary cards and charts.
5. User applies filters (camera/date) or explores the interactive table.
6. Exports a filtered table as CSV or downloads a report.
