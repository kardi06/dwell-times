# 2. Background / Context

**Background:**  
Organizations with physical spaces—such as office buildings, malls, transit hubs, and campuses—often lack real-time, data-driven visibility into how those spaces are used. While many deploy camera-based systems, the raw data is difficult to analyze without specialized tools. Existing solutions are either too basic (manual review) or too complex/expensive (legacy video analytics platforms).

**Context:**
- Advances in camera AI (e.g., Corsight) make it easy to export structured event logs (CSV, JSON) detailing every appearance, movement, and crowd event.
- Facility and security teams want actionable analytics:  
  - How long do people linger (“dwell time”)?
  - Where and when are crowding risks highest?
  - Who are the repeat visitors, and what are the patterns?
  - Can we detect anomalies or improve crowd flow?
- Current workflows are manual, siloed, and slow.
- There is a need for a self-service analytics platform that works out-of-the-box with camera event files **today**, and can integrate directly with APIs **tomorrow**.

**Strategic Fit:**  
Dwell-Insight meets immediate operational needs (manual upload, dashboard) and lays a foundation for long-term automation, integration, and smarter real-time response.
