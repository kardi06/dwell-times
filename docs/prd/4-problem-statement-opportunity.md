# 4. Problem Statement / Opportunity

## Problem Statement
Organizations struggle to extract actionable insights from camera event and crowd data due to:
- Manual, time-consuming processes for uploading and analyzing data (CSV, JSON, etc.).
- Lack of unified, user-friendly dashboards for viewing dwell time, occupancy, and crowding analytics.
- Inability to quickly identify repeat visitors, peak times, or crowding risks without data engineering help.
- No clear pathway from file uploads today to automated, API-driven analytics tomorrow.

## Opportunity
By providing an out-of-the-box analytics platform that supports both manual uploads and future API integration, Dwell-Insight can:
- Dramatically reduce time-to-insight for facility and security teams.
- Increase situational awareness and operational responsiveness (e.g., opening more gates when crowds build).
- Democratize access to camera and crowd analytics, making it available to non-technical users.
- Serve as a foundation for future automation, alerting, and integration with organizational workflows.
