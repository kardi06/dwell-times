2. **Development workflow** for the entire team  
3. **Database schema** that supports MVP features
4. **Deployment pipeline** for production readiness

## **Next Steps:**

1. **Implement SETUP-001** (Project Setup & Development Environment)
2. **Then implement MVP-001** (MVP Core Analytics Dashboard Implementation)

This ensures your development team has a solid foundation before building the core analytics features. The setup story provides everything needed to start development efficiently and maintain code quality throughout the project!

+ # Data Processing & Analytics Engine
+ 
+ **Story ID:** DATA-001  
+ **Created:** 2025-01-27  
+ **Story Points:** 8 (Medium - complex data processing)  
+ **Priority:** High (Core functionality for MVP)
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## **User Story**
+ 
+ **As a** security operations manager  
+ **I want to** upload camera event data and have it automatically processed into meaningful analytics  
+ **So that** I can get immediate insights about dwell time, occupancy patterns, and visitor behavior without manual data analysis
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## **Acceptance Criteria**
+ 
+ ### 1. CSV Data Ingestion & Validation
+ - [ ] Parse CSV files with camera event data
+ - [ ] Validate required columns: timestamp, person_id, camera_id, event_type
+ - [ ] Handle various timestamp formats (ISO, Unix, custom formats)
+ - [ ] Detect and report data quality issues (missing values, invalid formats)
+ - [ ] Support file sizes up to 100MB with progress tracking
+ - [ ] Store raw data in PostgreSQL with proper indexing
+ 
+ ### 2. Dwell Time Calculation Engine
+ - [ ] Calculate dwell time for each person (time between entry and exit events)
+ - [ ] Handle multiple entry/exit events per person per session
+ - [ ] Aggregate dwell times by person, camera, and time periods
+ - [ ] Calculate average, median, and maximum dwell times
+ - [ ] Handle edge cases (incomplete sessions, data gaps)
+ - [ ] Store calculated dwell time data in optimized format
+ 
+ ### 3. Analytics Computation Service
+ - [ ] Real-time calculation of KPI metrics:
+   - Total unique visitors
+   - Average dwell time per person
+   - Maximum dwell time observed
+   - Total events processed
+   - Number of cameras with activity
+ - [ ] Generate occupancy analytics (visitors per time period)
+ - [ ] Calculate repeat visitor statistics
+ - [ ] Create time-based aggregations (hourly, daily, weekly)
+ - [ ] Cache analytics results for performance
+ 
+ ### 4. Data Aggregation & Grouping
+ - [ ] Group analytics by person, camera, time periods
+ - [ ] Support demographic attributes if present in data
+ - [ ] Create summary statistics for each grouping
+ - [ ] Generate data for chart visualizations
+ - [ ] Optimize queries for large datasets
+ 
+ ### 5. API Endpoints for Analytics
+ - [ ] REST API endpoints for retrieving analytics data
+ - [ ] Support for filtering by date range, camera, person
+ - [ ] Pagination for large result sets
+ - [ ] JSON response format for frontend consumption
+ - [ ] API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
+ 
+ ### 6. Error Handling & Data Quality
+ - [ ] Comprehensive error handling for malformed data
+ - [ ] Data validation and cleaning procedures
+ - [ ] Logging of processing errors and warnings
+ - [ ] User-friendly error messages for invalid data
+ - [ ] Data quality metrics and reporting

+ ### Database Schema Extensions
+ ```sql
+ -- Extended camera events table with calculated fields
+ ALTER TABLE camera_events ADD COLUMN session_id VARCHAR(100);
+ ALTER TABLE camera_events ADD COLUMN dwell_duration INTEGER;
+ ALTER TABLE camera_events ADD COLUMN is_entry BOOLEAN;
+ ALTER TABLE camera_events ADD COLUMN is_exit BOOLEAN;
+ 
+ -- Analytics cache table for performance
+ CREATE TABLE analytics_cache (
+     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
+     cache_key VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
+     metric_data JSONB NOT NULL,
+     calculated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
+     expires_at TIMESTAMP
+ );
+ 
+ -- Person sessions table for dwell time tracking
+ CREATE TABLE person_sessions (
+     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
+     session_id VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
+     person_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
+     camera_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
+     entry_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
+     exit_time TIMESTAMP,
